# OutliPy
OutliPy is a lightweight Python library for detecting, handling, and visualizing outliers in tabular datasets. Built on top of Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, it streamlines the process of identifying and managing irregular data points that may distort analysis or model performance.  The library offers flexible outlier detection methods, including IQR, Z-score, and percentile-based approaches. Users can easily tag, remove, or report outliers, as well as generate visual summaries such as boxplots and distribution charts.  Designed with a clean and intuitive interface, OutliPy supports a variety of data cleaning workflows — from quick exploratory analysis to full preprocessing pipelines. Whether for research, analytics, or production data pipelines, OutliPy helps ensure data integrity and clarity with minimal effort.
