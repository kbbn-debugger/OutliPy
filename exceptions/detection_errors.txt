✅ 1. InvalidColumnException — ICE-series

Purpose: Column-related validation failures before detection or handling.

Recommended ICE codes

ICE001 – Missing columns (done)

ICE002 – Invalid columns (not in DataFrame) (done)

ICE003 – No valid numeric columns among selected ones (done)

ICE004 – Column exists but contains only NaN (to be made)

ICE005 – Unsupported column dtype (object, category, datetime) (done)

ICE006 – Duplicate column names (to be made)

ICE007 – Empty column (0 non-NaN values) (to be made)

✔ These belong here — not in DetectionException.

✅ 2. ConfigurationException — CON-series

Purpose: Invalid or inconsistent detector/handler configuration.

Examples:

Using a threshold < 0

Passing both k and contamination, which are mutually exclusive

Passing unexpected keyword arguments to a detector

Missing required parameters

Recommended CON codes

CON001 – Missing required configuration parameter

CON002 – Invalid parameter value (e.g., threshold ≤ 0)

CON003 – Conflicting configuration parameters

CON004 – Unsupported detection method

CON005 – Parameter type mismatch

CON006 – Too few rows to use chosen method

✔ These do not belong in DetectionException.

✅ 3. DetectionException — DET-series

Purpose: Failures during the detection algorithm itself.
Meaning: Input was valid, configuration was valid — but the detection method failed at runtime.

This list must stay tight and algorithm-focused.

Recommended DET Codes

DET001 – No data left after preprocessing
(e.g., entire column became NaN after cleaning)

DET002 – No numeric data available for computation
(all values dropped or became non-numeric mid-process)

DET003 – Zero variance
(z-score fails)

DET004 – Zero IQR
(IQR detector cannot compute bounds)

DET005 – Zero MAD (median absolute deviation)
(Modified z-score fails)

DET006 – Score computation resulted in NaN or inf
(normalization step failed)

DET007 – Detection flagged zero rows unexpectedly
(e.g., threshold too extreme or array collapsed)

DET008 – Detection flagged all rows
(often indicates threshold miscalibration)

DET009 – Custom detector returned wrong shape or dtype
(output misaligned with DataFrame)

✔ These are true detection-stage failures, not validation errors.

✅ 4. MultivariateException — MVT-series

Purpose: Errors specific to multivariate algorithms (Mahalanobis, PCA, covariance-based detection).

Recommended MVT Codes

MVT001 – Singular covariance matrix
(cannot invert)

MVT002 – Too few samples for multivariate method
(rows < dimensions)

MVT003 – Non-positive-definite covariance matrix

MVT004 – Mahalanobis distance computation failed
(NaN, inf, or unexpected outputs)

MVT005 – Corrupted or ill-conditioned matrix

✔ Keeps multivariate concerns from polluting general detection errors.

✅ 5. HandlingException — HEX-series

Purpose: Failures in the handling stage (removal, replacement, winsorization).

Recommended HEX Codes

HEX001 – Handling method is not supported

HEX002 – Strategy requires numeric data, but none available

HEX003 – Replacement value invalid or out of bounds

HEX004 – Winsorization produced invalid results

HEX005 – Attempted to replace outliers in non-numeric columns

HEX006 – No outliers found for handling, but handling was forced

✔ These are never detection failures.
